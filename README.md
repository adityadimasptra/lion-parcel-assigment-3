# Introduction

This project runs a simple Node.js application with the main entry point being `index.js`.
```bash
Create a reusable function to solve the issue. The function should return an array of
integers sorted in descending order, even numbers first then odd numbers from the input
array.
input : [3,2,5,1,8,9,6]
output : [8,6,2,9,5,3,1]
```
